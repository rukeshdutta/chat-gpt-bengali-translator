# chat-gpt-bengali-translator
Made a translator app using openai's da-vinci. Takes in English and spits out Bengali. Used gTTS for the audio file creation. It sounds a bit weird. May need to tweak, interestingly the whole code was written by chatGPT, I edited some portions to fix a few bugs. ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«ğŸ¤«
